 abstract = {Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) is an emerging learning paradigm that tackles the task of training a machine learning (ML) model to predict missing parameters of an incomplete optimization problem in which the missing problem parameters are completed by a prediction. DFL trains an ML model in an end-to-end system by integrating the prediction and optimization tasks, providing better alignment of the training and testing objectives. DFL has shown a lot of promise and holds the capacity to revolutionize decision-making in many real-world applications. However, very little is known about the performance of these models under adversarial attacks. We adopt ten unique DFL methods and benchmark their performance under two distinctly focused attacks adapted towards Predict-then-Optimize-based problems. Our results lead us to hypothesize that the models' robustness is highly correlated with the model's ability to find predictions that lead to optimal solutions without deviating from the ground-truth label. Furthermore, we provide insight into how to target the models that do violate this condition and show how these models respond differently depending on the achieved optimality at the end of their training cycles}

 abstract = {Achieving fusion of deep learning with combinatorial algorithms promises transformative changes to AI. Creating an impact in a real-world setting requires AI techniques to span a pipeline from data, to predictive models, to decisions. Aligning these components together requires careful consideration, as having these components trained separately does not account for the end goal of the model. This work surveys general frameworks for melding these components, we focus on the integration of optimization methods with machine learning architectures. We address some challenges and limitations associated with these methods and propose a novel approach to address some of the bottlenecks that arise}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
