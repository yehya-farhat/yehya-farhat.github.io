I'm currently a research scholar at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a> working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gvenkata/home">Prof. Venkata Gandikota </a>.

My research interests are in Scientific Machine Learning, Constrained Optimization, and Differential Optimization. I'm broadly interested in the following research themes: <br>

<strong>Leveraging AI models to tackle complex engineering and scientific problems:</strong> This entails leveraging data-driven algorithms that incorporate domain knowledge to learn fast approximate solutions for challenging PDEs and constrained optimization problems, while also developing frameworks to integrate constrained reasoning with deep learning, thereby enabling AI geared towards science and engineering. <br>

<strong>Understanding the expressive capabilities of deep learning models through a theoretical lens:</strong> My aim is to establish theoretical frameworks that can assist in establishing performance bounds for deep learning models and facilitate better model interpretability. <br>

<strong>Convex and Non-Convex Optimization:</strong> Developing theoretically sound and empirically robust optimization methods for large-scale optimization problems. Additionally, I am particularly interested in enhancing our understanding and development of learning algorithms to improve the training and generalization of deep learning models.



Previously, I earned a M.Sc. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>. In my last year of graduate studies, I completed my thesis on end-to-end constrained optimization learning with a focus on decision-focused learning under the supervision of <a href="https://nandofioretto.github.io/">Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto</a> . Before that, I received a B.Sc in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of Beirut (AUB)</a>.
