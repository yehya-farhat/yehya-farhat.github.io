I'm currently a research intern at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a> working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gvenkata/home">Prof. Venkata Gandikota </a>. Our research is focused on understanding the expressiveness of deep neural networks by studying the dynamics of the linear regions attained by the network. We are also investigating efficient ways of counting the number of regions

My research interests are in Machine Learning, Constrained Optimization, and Differential Optimization. I'm Broadly interested in the following research themes: <br> 
<strong>Applying ML models to tackle complex engineering and scientific problems:</strong> This entails using ML models to learn fast approximate solvers for hard optimization problems and developing methods to integrate constrained optimization and deep learning, enabling AI geared towards science and engineering.<br>
<strong>Understanding the expressive capabilities of deep learning models through a theoretical lens:</strong> My aim is to establish theoretical frameworks that can assist in establishing performance bounds for deep learning models and facilitate better model interpretability.<br> 
<strong>Optimization algorithms:</strong> Convex and Non-Convex Optimization.





I earned a M.Sc. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>. In my last year of graduate studies I completed my thesis on end-to-end constrained optimization learning with a focus on decision focused learning under the supervision of <a href="https://nandofioretto.github.io/">Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto</a> 

Before that i was at the <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of Beirut (AUB)</a>, I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics
