I'm a <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a> graduate with an M.S. in Computer Science. My research interests are in Machine Learning, Constrained Optimization, and Differential Optimization. I'm Broadly interested in the following research themes: <br> 
<strong>Understanding the expressive capabilities of deep learning models through a theoretical lens:</strong> My aim is to establish theoretical frameworks that can assist in establishing performance bounds for deep learning models and facilitate better model interpretability.<br> 
<strong>Applying ML models to tackle complex engineering and scientific problems:</strong> This entails using ML models to learn fast approximate solvers for hard optimization problems and developing methods to integrate constrained optimization and deep learning, enabling AI geared towards science and engineering.<br>
<strong>Optimization algorithms:</strong> Convex and Non-Convex Optimization.





In my last year of graduate studies I completed my thesis on end-to-end constrained optimization learning with a focus on the decision focused learning paradigm under the supervision of <a href="https://nandofioretto.github.io/">Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto</a> 

Before that i was at the <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of Beirut (AUB)</a>, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics
