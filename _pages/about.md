I am a first year PhD student in computer science at <a href="https://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/">Anastasios Kyrillidis</a> and I am also part of the <a href="https://akyrillidis.github.io/aiowls/">AI OWLS</a> research cluster at Rice. 

 
My broad research objective is to develop scalable and rigorous methods for explaining and enhancing AI models. Additionally, I am keenly interested in applying machine learning to overcome a broad spectrum of bottlenecks encountered in real-world engineering and scientific challenges.<br>
I'm interested in the following research themes: <br>

<ul>
<li><strong>Leveraging AI models to tackle complex engineering and scientific problems</strong> </li><br>

<li><strong>Understanding the expressive capabilities of deep learning models through a theoretical lens</strong> </li><br>

<li><strong>Convex and Non-Convex Optimization</strong></li>
</ul>


I was a research scholar at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gvenkata/home">Prof. Venkata Gandikota</a>. I previously earned an M.Sc. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>, where I completed a thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://nandofioretto.github.io/">Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto</a>. Before that, I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of Beirut (AUB)</a>.

In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, staying active by playing football, and hitting the gym. I am also an avid writer passionate about sharing intriguing scientific topics I encounter. To stay updated, you can check out and subscribe to my newsletter below! Or find me on Medium.
