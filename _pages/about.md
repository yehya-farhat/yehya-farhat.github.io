I'm currently a research scholar at <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a> working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gvenkata/home">Prof. Venkata Gandikota </a>.

My research interests are in Machine Learning, Constrained Optimization, and Differential Optimization. I'm broadly interested in the following research themes: <br>

<strong>Applying ML models to tackle complex engineering and scientific problems:</strong> This entails leveraging data-driven algorithms that incorporate domain knowledge to learn fast approximate solutions for hard optimization problems and developing methods to integrate constrained reasoning and deep learning, enabling AI geared towards science and engineering. <br>

<strong>Understanding the expressive capabilities of deep learning models through a theoretical lens:</strong> My aim is to establish theoretical frameworks that can assist in establishing performance bounds for deep learning models and facilitate better model interpretability. <br>

<strong>Convex and Non-Convex Optimization:</strong> Developing theoretically sound and empirically robust optimization methods for large-scale optimization problems; this also includes augmenting optimization solvers with ML components to develop fast approximate solutions.


Previously, I earned a M.Sc. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>. In my last year of graduate studies, I completed my thesis on end-to-end constrained optimization learning with a focus on decision-focused learning under the supervision of <a href="https://nandofioretto.github.io/">Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto</a> . Before that, I received a B.Sc in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of Beirut (AUB)</a>.
