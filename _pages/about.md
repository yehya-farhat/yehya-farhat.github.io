I'm a <a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a> graduate with an M.S. in Computer Science. My research interests are in combinatorial optimization and machine learning. I'm very much interested applying machine learning models to tackle complex engineering and scientific problems. 

In my last year of graduate studies I completed my thesis on decision focused learning under the supervision of <a href="https://nandofioretto.github.io/">Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto</a> 

Before that i was at the <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of Beirut (AUB)</a>, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Sciece and a minor in Mathematics
