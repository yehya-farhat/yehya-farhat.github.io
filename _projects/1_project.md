The usage of automated theorem provers is on the rise, and they have recently had a hand in aiding in proving new mathematical results. With the rise of AI, would it be possible to extend these models to help humans solve complicated mathematical theorems? <br>

Mathematical theorems are but logical sequences of symbols, making them a perfect target for Natural Language Processing techniques. In this work, I collaborate with two other team members to implement attention-based mechanisms for learning higher-order logic theorem proving. We implemented attention-based models and trained them on the HolStep dataset in an attempt to study automatic theorem proving.
