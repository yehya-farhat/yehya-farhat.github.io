Worked alongside three teammates to create a petition website for the American University of Beirut. This website allows students to upload their petitions and transcripts, which are then automatically parsed. If the students fulfill the criteria for the petition, the chairperson is instantly alerted.

This initiative significantly optimized the process, alleviating the chairperson from the extensive hours formerly dedicated to sorting and scrutinizing transcripts to verify if students met the petition standards.
