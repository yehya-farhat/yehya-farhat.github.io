Collaborated with a colleague to create a native Processing3 Image Processing Tool (IMP). This software enables users to upload images and apply a variety of manipulations, including cropping, sharpening, adjusting contrast, converting to grayscale, and utilizing a broad array of other image enhancement tools.
